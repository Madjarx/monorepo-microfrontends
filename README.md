# yarn-monorepo

I wanna add nodemon scripts that will kill ports and restart the apps when theres a change in webpack config js

I also want to add shell scripts that will put the result of npx-create-mf-app --yarn to packages folder
and also find a way to pass arguments to it, like react, scss or something

ALL IN BASH

make them available in the whole repo, install them globally or something idk i dont wanna think about that now, i gotta configure mfes
